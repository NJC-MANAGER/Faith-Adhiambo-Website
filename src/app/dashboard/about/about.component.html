  <h2>Innovating for Change, Leading with Purpose</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Faith Adhiambo, a passionate software engineer, social advocate, and lifelong learner committed to using technology as a force for positive change. With a background in finance and expertise in frontend development, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and social justice, bringing innovative solutions to communities that need them most.</p>

  <p>Throughout my career, I've worked on projects that range from developing user-friendly applications to supporting businesses in streamlining their operations through technology. I’m skilled in Angular, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and TypeScript, and I enjoy building intuitive, impactful user experiences. But beyond coding, I believe in leading with integrity, empowering others, and making a tangible difference through technology.</p>

  <p>I'm also deeply committed to mentoring young women and advocating for equal opportunities in the tech industry. My vision is to create a more inclusive tech space where innovation thrives through diversity, and everyone has the opportunity to excel, regardless of their background.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I’m a health enthusiast, a budding pianist, and an avid volunteer in community projects. Whether it’s through leading projects, speaking at events, or just having meaningful conversations, my mission is to inspire, empower, and lead with purpose.</p>
